Plan</h1>
<!-- Last updated: 2026-01-27 21:00 -->
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This document is the <strong>master, traceable closeout
deliverable</strong> for an EV charging site electrical project. It
presents a complete, phase-structured record of how an EV charging
installation was engineered, reviewed, submitted, revised, and
finalized, with every key decision tied back to its inputs and
supporting evidence.</p>
<p>The plan is organized into <strong>eight phases (Phase 1 through
Phase 8)</strong>. Within each phase, the document identifies the
prerequisite inputs and how they were provided, establishes a stable
evidence index (so files can be retrieved unambiguously), and summarizes
how each deliverable was created (calculations, decision records,
compilation/QA logs). It also preserves an audit trail of external
review cycles—authority plan check and serving utility review—by
capturing submission packages, receipts, comment logs, response letters,
and approvals/finaled evidence.</p>
<p>The intent is not to restate every technical detail in prose, but to
provide a defensible chain of custody: what information was relied on,
how assumptions were verified and frozen, what artifacts were produced,
and what evidence demonstrates acceptance at each checkpoint.</p>
<p>For readers who are not familiar with how electrical work is reviewed
and validated in California, the <strong>Introduction</strong> section
provides the operational context—how AHJs and utilities function as
separate audit systems, why “written code” and “enforced code” diverge
in practice, and why traceability and early risk characterization
materially affect delivery outcomes.</p>

<p><a id="introduction"></a></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In California, electrical engineering work is validated externally by
two independent authorities: the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) and
the serving electrical utility. AHJs enforce the adopted California
Electrical Code and local amendments through plan check and inspection.
Utilities are not code enforcers; they manage grid and asset risk,
reviewing added load, service impacts, fault duty, and—in EV
projects—the credibility of any claimed load-management scheme. These
entities do not coordinate with each other and do not participate in
design. They review finished artifacts only.</p>
<p>In the San Francisco Bay Area, the AHJ is typically the city or
county building department responsible for electrical permits. A
multifamily EV project in Palo Alto, for example, is reviewed by the
City of Palo Alto – Building Division, while a similar project nearby
may face a different department with different amendments, reviewer
expectations, and enforcement thresholds. The serving utility runs a
parallel review with different criteria and timelines. Same written
code, materially different enforcement outcomes.</p>
<p>Both AHJs and utilities operate as audit systems. They do not accept
undocumented reasoning, verbal explanations, or implied engineering
intent. Anything not written, indexed, and traceable is treated as
nonexistent. Most comments and deficiencies are not about incorrect
calculations but about failure to demonstrate how inputs flowed into
outputs and whether assumptions were verified, frozen, and consistently
applied. This is why written code ≠ enforced code in practice, and why
designing purely to the most conservative interpretation everywhere
results in systematic over-engineering.</p>
<p>Over-engineering is not a neutral safety margin in California; it is
economically destructive. The state faces a chronic scarcity of licensed
EEs and especially PEs, which drives very high labor costs. Every
unnecessary design iteration, oversizing decision, or avoidable service
upgrade consumes scarce senior hours that cannot be amortized. When
firms respond to regulatory uncertainty with blanket conservatism, they
burn the most expensive resource they have and compress margins without
meaningfully reducing approval risk.</p>
<p>Modeling each AHJ—what they actually enforce, what they routinely
question, and where they allow judgment—is therefore critical. Precise
alignment to enforcement reality allows designs that are code-compliant,
defensible, and no more complex than necessary. This reduces PE touch
time, limits redesign cycles, and keeps projects within a labor envelope
that is survivable given market scarcity.</p>
<p>Utilities must be modeled with the same rigor. Written utility
standards, handbooks, or greenbooks do not reflect how load increases,
EMS claims, or service constraints are actually reviewed in practice.
Utilities differ materially in what they flag, what they defer, what
they require upfront, and what they reopen later in the process.
Treating utilities as deterministic rule engines leads to the same
failure mode as over-interpreting code: unnecessary conservatism, late
surprises, and unplanned rework. Capturing utility behavior—what
documentation they demand, how they evaluate managed load, and where
they apply discretion—is essential to avoiding service upgrades and
uncontrolled scope growth.</p>
<p>Profitability depends on this discipline starting early. Correctly
characterizing a project’s regulatory and utility risk at intake—based
on service conditions, load posture, AHJ enforcement behavior, and
utility sensitivity—and fitting it into a canonical, repeatable form is
what enables accurate pricing. When risk is explicitly classified rather
than discovered midstream, fees can reflect true exposure, delivery
plans can be matched to risk class, and engineers can execute with
confidence that the work is achievable within tolerable margins. In
California EE practice, traceability, AHJ and utility modeling, and
early risk canonicalization are prerequisites for operating profitably
under scarcity and scrutiny.</p>
<p>The two comparison tables below make these claims concrete by showing
how differences in grid/permit governance and liability structure can
force additional phases, rework loops, or evidence requirements
(relative to California).</p>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Feasibility and Recommendation for

<h4 id="screening-calculation-basis-not-permit-grade">1.6.9 Screening
Calculation Basis (Not Permit-Grade)</h4>
<p>Per applicable code requirements, EV charging loads are typically

<h4 id="method">1.6.11 Method</h4>
<p>Phase 1 computes a screening current envelope using best-available
intent data and applies a continuous-load factor where appropriate. If

here, Phase 1 conclusions must be revisited and may require load
management or other architecture changes (Phase 3).</p>

<h4 id="gono-go-criteria-phase-1">1.6.13 Go/No-Go Criteria (Phase
1)</h4>
<p><strong>GO</strong> is valid only if all conditions below remain true
after Phase 2 validation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified service characteristics (1-I02) match the screening basis
(rating and voltage/phase).</li>
<li>Verified EVSE cut sheets (1-I03 → frozen in Phase 2) do not
materially increase the continuous current beyond the screening
assumptions.</li>
<li>Formal NEC/CEC load calculation (Phase 3) confirms compliance; if
unmanaged loading exceeds headroom, a compliant load-management
architecture must be adopted (Phase 3).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion-and-recommendation">1.6.14 Conclusion and
Recommendation</h4>
<p><strong>GO (Conditional – Managed Load Required)</strong></p>
<p>Based on screening-level inputs <strong>1-I01 / 1-I02 /
1-I03</strong>, the unmanaged code-continuous EV load for 8 ports is
<strong>320 A</strong>, which exceeds the estimated <strong>250
A</strong> historical service headroom by <strong>70 A</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>conditional GO</strong> that requires a compliant
<strong>load management / EMS</strong> approach in Phase 3 (/Phase 3) to
cap aggregate EV demand at or below the available headroom, or an
alternate approach (e.g., fewer ports or different EVSE ratings) to be
validated by the Engineer-of-Record.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">1.7 Next Steps</h3>
<p>Proceed to <strong>Phase 2: Data Collection and Site
Analysis</strong> to (a) freeze EVSE cut sheets and electrical
characteristics in the intake package (Phase 2) and (b) verify
service/gear data. Then proceed to <strong>Phase 3</strong> to complete
the formal load calculation (Phase 3) and system architecture decision
(Phase 3).</p>

<p>This section formalizes the outputs of <strong>Phase 3: System Design

Site Project. Phase 3 uses the controlled Phase 2 package (Phase 2) to
produce a <strong>permit-relevant electrical load calculation</strong>
and an <strong>architecture decision record</strong> suitable to seed
the drawing set in Phase 4.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Phase 3 fields below are filled with
<strong>example data</strong> to demonstrate a “completed” master
deliverable package (provenance, stable evidence pointers, and decision
logs). Replace all names, dates, and evidence pointers with real project
records before using this document externally.</p>

<p>Phase 3 captures information required to perform electrical

<ul>
<li><strong>Civil / constructability</strong> topics
(routing/trenching/means-and-methods, installation sequencing,
etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of Phase 3 is to confirm that the proposed EV charging
system is electrically viable and compliant with the applicable code
basis (CEC/NEC as adopted by the AHJ), and to select a compliant system
architecture that satisfies the project’s electrical constraint of
avoiding a service upgrade unless unavoidable.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The total NEC continuous load is
<strong>320 Amps</strong>. This confirms that the previously available
<strong>250 Amps</strong> of service headroom (Phase 1) is
<em>insufficient</em> to support the full, unmanaged, NEC-mandated
continuous load.</p>
<h4 id="service-headroom-re-evaluation">3.5.2 Service Headroom
Re-Evaluation</h4>
<p>Phase 1 () established that an unmanaged, code-continuous EV load for
8 ports would exceed the available historical headroom and therefore
requires a managed load approach. The formal Phase 3 calculation
confirms <strong>320 Amps</strong> unmanaged continuous load versus
<strong>250 Amps</strong> available headroom, necessitating an
<strong>Energy Management System (EMS)</strong> (or another compliant
demand/management method) per NEC 625.42(A)(2).</p>

<p>The notes sheet explicitly references the <strong>2022 California
Electrical Code (CEC)</strong> and the use of the <strong>NEC
625.42(A)(2)</strong> method (EMS) to justify the 250A managed load. Key
notes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Load Management:</strong> The EV subpanel utilizes a
listed Energy Management System (EMS) to cap the maximum aggregate
demand at 250 Amps to prevent exceeding the available service
headroom.</li>
<li><strong>B. Continuous Loads:</strong> All EV loads are calculated at
125% demand factor per NEC 625.42.</li>
<li><strong>C. Wiring:</strong> All conductors shall be sized per NEC
310 and rated for 75°C minimum.</li>

Authority Review and Drawing Revision</h2>
<h3 id="phase-6-purpose">6.1 Phase 6 Purpose</h3>
<p>Phase 6 documents the AHJ plan check review, parses all AHJ comments
into an auditable log, produces revised drawings addressing those
comments, and records responses in a formal comment response letter. It
explicitly captures the <strong>rework loop caused by AHJ
pushback</strong> (comment intake → disposition → drawing changes →
resubmission → approval evidence) so the revision path is traceable and
defensible.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Phase 6 fields below are filled with
<strong>example data</strong> to demonstrate a “completed” master
deliverable package (provenance, stable filenames, and revision logs).
Replace all names, dates, and evidence pointers with real project
records before using this document externally.</p>

Coordination</h2>
<h3 id="phase-7-purpose">7.1 Phase 7 Purpose</h3>
<p>Phase 7 documents coordination with the local electrical utility to
communicate the planned EV load addition and any load-management method,
submit required utility application forms, and archive all utility
correspondence/receipts. It also records the <strong>utility-driven
rework cycle</strong> when the initial submission receives pushback
(deficiency notice → rework package → resubmission → final
acknowledgment) so utility concerns and responses remain auditable.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Phase 7 fields below are filled with
<strong>example data</strong> to demonstrate a “completed” master
deliverable package (provenance, stable filenames, and coordination
logs). Replace all names, dates, and evidence pointers with real project
records before using this document externally.</p>
<h3 id="phase-7-boundaries-electrical-only">7.2 Phase 7 Boundaries
(Electrical-Only)</h3>
<p>Phase 7 captures technical utility coordination artifacts (load
letters, single-line/one-line as requested by the utility, and utility
portal forms). It intentionally excludes:</p>

<li><strong>Civil / constructability</strong> topics
(routing/trenching/means-and-methods, installation sequencing,

Addendum C: Energy Management System (EMS) Architecture &amp; Control
Logic</h2>
<h3 id="core-hardware-components">14.1 Core Hardware Components</h3>
<p>While the One-Line Diagram (P3.1) focuses on power flow, the EMS
“nervous system” consists of the following components that facilitate
the Sense-Think-Act loop:</p>
<p><strong>Current Transformer (CT) Array</strong>: High-precision
“clamshell” sensors installed on the main service busbars. These measure
the magnetic field of the total building draw in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>EMS Controller / Local Gateway</strong>: An industrial-grade
microcomputer (typically DIN-rail mounted in the EV subpanel). It serves
as the local intelligence hub, capable of operating even during internet
outages.</p>
<p><strong>Grid Communication Interface</strong>: A dedicated bridge
(often Modbus or RS485) that translates the analog signals from the CTs
into digital data for the controller.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-software-interfaces">14.2 Hardware &amp; Software
Interfaces</h3>
<p>The system operates across three primary interface layers:</p>
<p><strong>Physical Interface (CT-to-Gateway)</strong>: Shielded
twisted-pair wiring that transmits the live amperage readings from the
main switchgear to the EMS controller.</p>
<p><strong>Local Network Interface (Gateway-to-Charger)</strong>:
Usually an Ethernet or robust Mesh Wi-Fi network using the OCPP (Open
Charge Point Protocol) to send throttling commands to each of the 8
stations.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud API Interface</strong>: An encrypted outbound
connection (Cellular or WAN) used for remote monitoring, firmware
updates, and reporting.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-the-cloud">14.3 The Role of the Cloud</h3>
<p>The Cloud does not perform the real-time load shedding—that is
handled locally for safety and speed. Instead, the Cloud provides:</p>
<p><strong>Priority Profiles</strong>: Allows the owner to designate
specific chargers for “VIP” or “Fleet” priority via a web dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Data Logging</strong>: Records proof for the utility (Taylor
Nguyen) that the 250A cap was never exceeded.</p>
<p><strong>Latency Compensation</strong>: Monitors network health to
ensure commands are reaching chargers within the required 2-second
window.</p>
<h3 id="control-logic-maintaining-the-250a-max">14.4 Control Logic:
Maintaining the 250A Max</h3>
<p>The EMS maintains the limit through a continuous mathematical
loop:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Measurement</strong>: Total Site Load (P<sub>total</sub>)
is measured by CTs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculation</strong>: Available EV Power
(P<sub>avail</sub>) = 250A − P<sub>building</sub>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Command</strong>: If P<sub>total</sub> &gt; 245A, the EMS
sends a “SetChargingProfile” command via OCPP to all 8
chargers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Throttling</strong>: Chargers reduce their pilot signal
(PWM), forcing the cars to drop current instantly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fail-Safe</strong>: If the Gateway loses contact with the
CTs or the Cloud, all chargers default to 6A (minimum) to ensure the
main breaker never trips.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><a id="addendum-d"></a></p>
<h2 id="addendum-d-three-phase-distribution-phase-balancing-logic">15
Addendum D: Three-Phase Distribution &amp; Phase Balancing Logic</h2>
<h3 id="the-wye-distribution-strategy">15.1 The “Wye” Distribution
Strategy</h3>
<p>The project utilizes a 208Y/120V Three-Phase Wye configuration. This
is the standard “Workhorse” of commercial buildings in California.</p>
<p><strong>The 3P Feeder</strong>: The wires coming from the main
service to the EV Subpanel (Panel B) carry all three phases (A, B, and
C). This allows us to pull power from three different “lanes” of the
grid simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>The 1P Load</strong>: Because the vehicles are North American
spec (Single-Phase), they can only bridge two of these phases at a time
to get 208V (e.g., A-B, B-C, or C-A).</p>
<h3 id="the-hidden-balancing-logic">15.2 The “Hidden” Balancing
Logic</h3>
<p>To prevent a “Phase Imbalance”—which causes heat in the neutral wire
and stresses the utility transformer—the 8 chargers are distributed
across the phases in a 3-3-2 staggered pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Group 1 (Stations 1, 4, 7)</strong>: Connected to Phase A
and B.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Group 2 (Stations 2, 5, 8)</strong>: Connected to Phase B
and C.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Group 3 (Stations 3, 6)</strong>: Connected to Phase C
and A.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By spreading the chargers this way, we ensure that if all 8 cars are
charging at full tilt, the load on any single phase (A, B, or C) stays
relatively equal, maximizing the 250A headroom provided by the
utility.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-schedule-looks-messy">15.3 Why the Schedule Looks
“Messy”</h3>
<p>A standard Panel Schedule is organized by Circuit Numbers, not by
Phase Group. This can make the balancing logic difficult to see at a
glance:</p>
<p><strong>Standard Numbering</strong>: Circuits 1 &amp; 3 are Phase
A-B; Circuits 5 &amp; 7 are Phase B-C; Circuits 9 &amp; 11 are Phase
C-A.</p>
<p><strong>The Visual Jumble</strong>: Because breakers are installed
vertically (1, 3, 5, 7…), the “Phase A” column on the schedule will have
values for Station 1 and Station 3, but nothing for Station 2.</p>
<p><strong>Verification</strong>: To confirm the balance, ignore the
individual rows and look at the KVA Totals at the bottom of the
schedule. In a balanced design, the totals for Phase A, B, and C should
be within 5% of each other.</p>
<h3 id="physical-integration-note">15.4 Physical Integration Note</h3>
<p>The 250A EVSP Feeder will utilize the contiguous spare breaker
section (Slots 24-42) of the MDP. This avoids the need for a “service
tap” or external “gutter” connection, which are common points of failure
in retrofits of this age. The large-frame 250A breaker will be centered
on the bus to ensure even heat dissipation across the 800A main
chassis.</p>
<p><a id="addendum-e"></a></p>
<h2 id="addendum-e-utility-integration-power-contractual-realities">16
Addendum E: Utility Integration &amp; Power Contractual Realities</h2>
<h3 id="section-a-the-requirement-for-utility-notification-phase-6">16.1
Section A: The Requirement for Utility Notification (Phase 6)</h3>
<p>A common misconception is that if a building’s 800A Main Distribution
Panel (MDP) has 250A of “spare” physical room, no utility coordination
is required. However, the Utility (PG&amp;E/SCE) must be involved for
three critical reasons that exist outside the building’s walls.</p>
<h4 id="asset-thermal-stress-the-continuous-load-factor">16.1.1 Asset
Thermal Stress (The Continuous Load Factor)</h4>
<p>Standard building loads (elevators, HVAC, lighting) are intermittent.
The utility sizes their neighborhood transformers based on a “diversity
factor”—assuming everyone won’t use max power at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>The Conflict</strong>: EV charging is a Continuous Load
(defined by the NEC as 3+ hours).</p>
<p><strong>The Risk</strong>: A transformer can handle a 550A “spike”
from your elevators for 15 minutes easily. It may not be able to handle
a sustained 800A draw for 8 hours without the internal cooling oil
overheating, leading to a “burn-out” that can plunge the entire block
into darkness.</p>
<h4 id="grid-visibility-rule-21-compliance">16.1.2 Grid Visibility &amp;
Rule 21 Compliance</h4>
<p>Under California Rule 21, utilities are tasked with maintaining grid
stability.</p>
<p><strong>Blind Spot</strong>: If 10 buildings on the same street all
add 250A of “hidden” EV load, the utility’s local distribution circuit
will become unstable.</p>
<p><strong>The Requirement</strong>: By submitting a Load Letter (Phase
6), you ensure Taylor Nguyen (the utility rep) can update their grid
model. If the transformer is too small, the utility is often required to
upgrade it at their own cost under Rule 29 (EV Infrastructure
Rules).</p>
<h4 id="secondary-service-wires">16.1.3 Secondary Service Wires</h4>
<p>The wires running from the street to your building (the Service Drop)
were sized based on your building’s original projected demand, not
necessarily its maximum 800A breaker rating. Increasing baseline
consumption by 250A creates persistent heat that can melt underground
insulation if the utility hasn’t confirmed the wire gauge is sufficient
for continuous duty.</p>
<h3 id="section-b-contracted-service-kva-vs.-physical-rating-amps">16.2
Section B: Contracted Service (kVA) vs. Physical Rating (Amps)</h3>
<p>While you “contract” a service in kVA (kilovolt-amperes), your
physical equipment is rated in Amps. This leads to the “Billing
vs. Safety” gap.</p>
<h4 id="the-service-agreement-id-said">16.2.1 The Service Agreement ID
(SAID)</h4>
<p>When your building was built, the owner signed a Service Agreement
for a specific kVA capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Contracted Demand</strong>: You may be paying a rate for 400
kVA of capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Peak</strong>: Your 800A MDP allows for ~288
kVA.</p>
<p><strong>The Gap</strong>: If you increase your usage to 250 kVA, you
are still under your 800A breaker, but you have exceeded your Contracted
Demand. This triggers a “Change of Service” request to avoid excessive
demand penalties and to legally update your power contract.</p>
<h4 id="understanding-the-kva-billing-model">16.2.2 Understanding the
kVA Billing Model</h4>
<p>Utility billing for commercial/multifamily sites relies on two
distinct charges:</p>
<p><strong>Energy Charge (kWh)</strong>: How much total fuel you
used.</p>
<p><strong>Demand Charge (kVA/kW)</strong>: The “width” of the pipe you
used at your single busiest 15-minute window.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: Adding 8 chargers significantly widens your
“pipe” usage. By involving the utility, you can often move to an
EV-specific rate (like PG&amp;E’s BEV rate), which reduces the kVA
demand charges in exchange for slightly higher kWh costs during peak
times.</p>
<h4 id="real-time-kva-management-via-ems">16.2.3 Real-Time kVA
Management via EMS</h4>
<p>The EMS (Energy Management System) hardware acts as the bridge
between your Physical Amps and your Contracted kVA.</p>
<p><strong>The Logic</strong>: The EMS is programmed with your
“Contracted Max kVA.”</p>
<p><strong>The Action</strong>: Even if your 250A breaker has “room,” if
the total building kVA starts to approach the contract limit, the EMS
will throttle the chargers to stay within the billing “sweet spot,”
protecting the owner from massive overage fees.</p>
<h3 id="summary-why-the-load-letter-is-your-legal-shield">16.3 Summary:
Why the Load Letter is your “Legal Shield”</h3>
<p>By providing a Load Letter that mentions your EMS, you are telling
the utility: “We are increasing our kVA demand, but our software will
prevent us from ever exceeding the 800A safety limit of our MDP and your
transformer.” This usually grants you an immediate “Approval to Proceed”
without expensive infrastructure upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="addendum-f-fault-current-arc-flash">17 Addendum F: Fault Current
&amp; Arc Flash</h2>
<p>This addendum explains why this project does not require a full
engineered fault current study or an arc flash study at the design
stage, and how AIC (Ampere Interrupting Capacity) ratings satisfy code
and inspection requirements.</p>
<h3 id="the-dwelling-unit-exception-nec-110.24">17.1 The “Dwelling Unit”
Exception (NEC 110.24)</h3>
<p>Under the National Electrical Code (NEC 110.24), which California
adopts, there is a specific exception for residential dwellings.</p>
<p><strong>The Rule:</strong> Service equipment in buildings other than
dwelling units must be field-marked with the maximum available fault
current.</p>
<p><strong>The Exception:</strong> Because this project is a multifamily
dwelling with a service likely under 1000A (the site has an 800A MDP),
the strict requirement for engineered fault current labeling is often
waived or simplified. The AHJ may accept the approach described in §17.3
(AIC ratings) in lieu of a separate fault study document.</p>
<h3 id="arc-flash-is-an-operational-study-not-a-design-study">17.2 Arc
Flash is an “Operational” Study, Not a “Design” Study</h3>
<p>Arc flash calculations (NFPA 70E) are designed to protect workers who
maintain equipment while it is energized.</p>
<p><strong>The Timing:</strong> In most California jurisdictions, an arc
flash study is considered a post-construction maintenance requirement,
not a permit-submission requirement.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Gap:</strong> To perform an accurate arc flash
study, the EE needs the exact manufacturer, model, and trip-settings of
every breaker installed. Since equipment has not been purchased yet
(Phase 7), any calculation done in Phase 3 would be a “best guess” and
legally invalid for OSHA-style labeling. A proper arc flash study is
therefore deferred until as-built conditions and installed equipment are
known.</p>
<h3 id="aic-ratings-handle-the-safety-implicitly">17.3 AIC Ratings
Handle the Safety “Implicitly”</h3>
<p>Instead of a full “Fault Study,” the EE uses AIC (Ampere Interrupting
Capacity) ratings.</p>
<p><strong>The Logic:</strong> Rather than calculating the exact fault
current, the engineer specifies that all new breakers (the 250A main and
the 40A branches) must have an AIC rating higher than the utility’s
available fault current (e.g., 65 kA AIC at 120/208 V).</p>
<p><strong>The Proof:</strong> This is checked by the City Inspector in
Phase 5 when they review the Short Circuit Current Rating (SCCR) on the
equipment spec sheets, effectively replacing the need for a separate
engineered fault current calculation document. The design basis (e.g.,
42 kA available at MDP, 65 kAIC minimum) is stated on the one-line and
in notes; the inspector verifies that installed equipment meets or
exceeds that rating.</p>
<h3 id="fault-current-verification-in-phase-6-utility-coordination">17.4
Fault Current Verification in Phase 6 (Utility Coordination)</h3>
<p>When contacting the utility representative (e.g., for the Load Letter
or service confirmation), you should request the <strong>Available Fault
Current at the Transformer</strong>. If that number is higher than 10 kA
(typical residential) or 22 kA (typical commercial), you must ensure the
250A EV feeder breaker is specified and installed with at least
<strong>65 kA AIC</strong>. For this reason, consider adding a
<strong>“Fault Current Verification”</strong> task to Phase 6 (Utility
Coordination): capture the utility-provided fault current value and
confirm that the specified 65 kAIC minimum for new breakers remains
adequate before equipment is ordered in Phase 7.</p>
<h3
id="phase-8-commissioning-optional-fault-study-arc-flash-labels">17.5
Phase 8 (Commissioning): Optional Fault Study &amp; Arc-Flash
Labels</h3>
<p>A fault current study remains <strong>optional</strong> at
commissioning but can be useful. Phase 8 is also when an electrician
would apply <strong>arc-flash safety stickers</strong> to the
equipment—if the building owner wants to be 100% OSHA-compliant for
maintenance personnel. That labeling relies on an arc flash study
performed with as-built data (see §17.2); if the owner opts for it, the
study and sticker application are typically completed during or shortly
after commissioning.</p>

Addendum G: After-the-Fact Gaps (EE, Compliance &amp; Strategic)</h2>
<p>This addendum summarizes critical gaps identified after the original
8-phase plan was established—items that may require additional
deliverables, studies, or design decisions depending on jurisdiction,
utility, and project scope. They are grouped into <strong>Electrical
Engineering (EE)</strong> requirements, <strong>Legal &amp; Physical
Compliance</strong> requirements, and <strong>Strategic “1,500
State”</strong> considerations (California’s patchwork of local reach
codes and utility clusters).</p>

Gaps</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALMS Logic Simulation:</strong> Proving to the AHJ that the

Current Rating to ensure chargers and associated equipment do not exceed
ratings during a fault if the utility transformer is particularly
“hot.”</li>
<li><strong>Harmonic Distortion:</strong> Accounting for the “noise” EV
chargers inject into the electrical system, which can overheat neutral
